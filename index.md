## About


### Technology
IOM harnesses recent robotic fabrication technologies to autonomously build and assemble complex products - including devices with circuits, actuators, and motors. It’s not rapid prototyping, it’s rapid production. 

Products are fabricated in a vertically integrated robotic ecosystem. Upon completion, they are are deposited in purpose-built boxes for immediate shipping. 

**Part Lifecycle**
1. Receive purchase order 
2. 3D-print part housing
3. Insert stock components 
4. Complete and test final assembly
5. Package for delivery

### Applications
**Use cases**
- Long-tail part manufacture
- Order fulfillment
- Product packaging
- Assembly line part sorting
