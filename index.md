## About


### Technology
IOM harnesses recent robotic fabrication technologies to autonomously build and assemble complex products - including devices with circuits, actuators, and motors. It’s not rapid prototyping, it’s rapid production. 

Products are fabricated in a vertically integrated robotic ecosystem. Upon completion, they are are deposited into purpose-built boxes for immediate shipping.
